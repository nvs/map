## Overview

**Map** is a collection of Warcraft III map management tools for [Lua].  It
can be used via the provided commands or by requiring various parts of the
library.

[Lua]: https://www.lua.org

## Installation

**Map** can be run using [Lua] `>= 5.1 and < 5.4` or [LuaJit] `>= 2.0`, so
long as the following dependencies are satisfied:

- [LuaFileSystem] `>= 1.7.0`
- [LPeg] `>= 1.0.2`
- [Luacheck] `>= 0.23.0`
- [lua-stormlib] `>= 0.2.0`
- [bit32] `>= 5.3.0` (for Lua 5.1; and Lua 5.3 compiled without
  `LUA_COMPAT_BITLIB`)
- [compat-5.3] `>= 0.5` (for Lua 5.1; Lua 5.2; and LuaJIT)

All dependencies are available through LuaRocks:

```
luarocks install luafilesystem
luarocks install lpeg
luarocks install luacheck
luarocks install lua-stormlib
luarocks install bit32
luarocks install compat53
```

To make use of **Map** it is recommended to place it directly within your
project's root directory.  That is, as `project/map`.  This can be achieved
a number of ways, including cloning the repository or including it as Git
submodule.

_Other installation locations are neither tested or supported._

[LuaFileSystem]: https://github.com/keplerproject/luafilesystem
[LPeg]: http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/lpeg
[Luacheck]: https://github.com/mpeterv/luacheck
[lua-stormlib]: https://github.com/nvs/lua-stormlib
[bit32]: https://github.com/keplerproject/lua-compat-5.2
[compat-5.3]: https://github.com/keplerproject/lua-compat-5.3

## Caveats

1. **TL;DR: Your mileage may vary.**  This library has not been extensively
   tested under any environment other than Linux.  Please backup any files
   before use.
2. Only Lua is supported.  Sorry, no more Jass.
3. There are not many fancy errors.  Using the Lua stack traceback to assist
   in understanding issues is recommended.

## Commands

The following commands are provided by the collection:

- `check`: Performs the following tasks, depending on settings found in the
  configuration file:

  - If `script` is provided, checks Lua scripts using [Luacheck].
  - If `build` is provided, procceses user build files.  Note that build
    files are run before any checks are made.
  - If `map` is provided, reads the input archive and exposes found
    information to the build environment.

- `build`: Performs all actions specified in the `check` command, in
  addition to the following:

  - If `script` is provided, packages the `war3map.lua` and performs a check
    on this file.
  - If `map` is provided, builds the output archive.  Changes to information
    exposed within the build environment will be reflected within.

All commands should be executed from within the project's root directory
(e.g. `map/check`).  Depending on setup, it may be necessary to pass the
command to the Lua binary (e.g. `lua map/check`).  Each command expects a
[configuration](#configuration) file as an input parameter (e.g. `map/check
configuration.lua`).

### Luacheck

A custom Luacheck standard representing the Lua environment in Warcraft
III is provided, and used by default, by **Map**.  Customization of one's
Luacheck experience is supported, and encouraged.  Simply consult the
[Luacheck documentation], and then follow the example in [Map's
`.luacheckrc`] for how to include the custom Warcraft III standards.

## Configuration

A configuration file is nothing more than a valid Lua file that returns a
`table` with the settings specified below.  The only valid types within the
configuration file are `nil`, `boolean`, `string`, and `table`.

Below is a sample configuration file.  Unless mentioned, a setting is
optional.

``` lua
-- # Settings
return {
    -- If this table is present, then various script related functionality
    -- will be performed.
    script = {
        -- The path of the root file used to generate the script.
        --
        -- This setting is required.
        input = 'path/to/input.lua',

        -- The path to use when creating the output script.
        --
        -- This setting is required.
        output = 'path/to/output.lua',

        -- Value to be used as the `package.path` when generating the
        -- script.  If absent, defaults to the `package.path` used for Map.
        package = {
            path = table.concat ({
                'lib/?.lua',
                'lib/?/init.lua'
            }, ';')
        },

        options = {
            -- Indicates whether to enable debug mode.  This will cause file
            -- names and line numbers in error messages to reflect the
            -- original locations.
            --
            -- By default, this option is disabled.  Listed are the accepted
            -- values for debug mode.  Note that 'name', the default mode
            -- should `true` be specified, will display the module's name.
            -- Setting the option to 'path' will display the file path.
            debug = false or nil or true or 'name' or 'path',

            -- Indicates whether to skip running Luacheck.
            --
            -- By default, this option is disabled.  Should `true` be
            -- specified, then all checks are disabled.  Setting the option
            -- to 'check' or 'build' will skip checks for those commands.
            skip_checks = false or nil or true or 'check' or 'build'
        }
    },

    -- If this table is present, then user build files will be processed.
    build = {
        -- The directory containing all user files that can be used to
        -- access and change the map environment.  It will be recursively
        -- traversed, and all Lua files within will be processed.
        --
        -- Note that when traversing directories, entries within are sorted
        -- using `table.sort ()`.  This should represent alphanumeric
        -- sorting.  This knowledge can be leveraged to ensure deterministic
        -- behavior.
        --
        -- If the build table is specified, this setting is required.
        directory = 'path/to/user/build/files',

        -- Values to be used as the `package.path` and `package.cpath`
        -- within user build files.  If absent, defaults to the paths used
        -- by Map.
        package = {
            path = table.concat ({
                'lib/?.lua',
                'lib/?/init.lua'
            }, ';'),

            cpath = table.concat ({
                'lib/?.so'
            }, ';')
        },

        options = {
            -- Indicates whether to disable build files, causing Map to
            -- behave as if the table was absent.
            --
            -- By default, this option is disabled.  Should `true` be
            -- specified, then build files are disabled.  Setting the
            -- option to 'check' or 'build' will disable build files for
            -- those commands.
            disable = false or nil or true or 'check' or 'build'
        }
    },

    -- If this table is present, then the input archive will be sourced for
    -- information to provide to the build environment.  Additionally, an
    -- output archive may be produced, depending on the command.
    map = {
        -- Path to the map file or directory that will be used as a basis
        -- for the built map.
        --
        -- If the map table is specified, this setting is required.
        input = 'path/to/input.w3x',

        -- The path to use when creating the output map.  Take care when
        -- specifying the path, as any existing file or directory at this
        -- specified location will be removed.
        --
        -- If the map table is specified, this setting is required.
        output = 'path/to/output.w3x',

        options = {
            -- Indicates that the output W3X archive should be directory
            -- based instead of MPQ based.  By default, this option is
            -- disabled.
            directory = false or nil or true
        }
    }
}
```

## Coding with Map

A typical [Lua] workflow involves utilizing [`require`] to break up projects
into modules, as well as using it to include externally defined modules.  If
you already do this, then you do not need to adjust your habits beyond the
following stated limitations:

1. Warcraft III's Lua environment does not include `require`.  Nor does it
   have a concept of multiple files.  To overcome this, **Map** will provide
   the needed plumbing when packaging the `war3map.lua` to make `require`
   work as expected.
2. Only modules on the specified Lua path are supported.  By default, this
   is the `package.path` used by **Map**.  However, this can be adjusted
   using the proper setting.  Modules using C loaders are not supported.
3. The analysis performed to identify uses of `require` is rather naive.
   Any clever uses of `require` will probably be missed (i.e. anything that
   is not a literal `string` value).
4. Do not needlessly use `require`.  Any detected usages will cause those
   modules to be packaged into the `war3map.lua`, even if their code is not
   run.
5. All moules are checked using [Luacheck], and warnings will be issued if
   globals not included in the Warcraft III Lua environment are utilized.
   Resolving such issues, if desired, and adjusting the `.luacheckrc`
   accordingly, is left up to the user.

## Environment

By specifying a `build` settings table, user build files will be processed.
If a `map` settings table is provided, then various map files can be loaded
on demand within the build environment.  The following map files are
supported via the specified keys:

- `information`: `war3map.w3i`
- `imports`: `war3map.imp`
- `objects`:
  - `war3map.w3a`
  - `war3map.w3b`
  - `war3map.w3d`
  - `war3map.w3h`
  - `war3map.w3q`
  - `war3map.w3t`
  - `war3map.w3u`
- `constants`:
  - `war3mapExtra.txt`
  - `war3mapMisc.txt`
  - `war3mapSkin.txt`
- `strings`: `war3map.wts`
- `regions`: `war3map.w3r`
- `cameras`: `war3map.w3c`
- `doodads`: `war3map.doo`
- `units`: `war3mapUnits.doo`
- `sounds`: `war3map.w3s`
- `terrain`: `war3map.w3e`
- `pathing`: `war3map.wpm`

Of particular note is that it is not the act of loading a file that causes
it to be repacked into the output archive.  It is merely the presence of a
Lua table at the specified key that causes Map to attempt to package the
data.  This process has higher priority than files listed in the imports
table (which is discussed below).  To prevent this processing, simply set
the value for a supported key to `nil`.  For example:

```lua
-- Name the build environment exposed by **Map** however you prefer.  This
-- table will be shared between all user build files.  One could store their
-- own data within, if they desire.  Just do not use one of the above keys.
local map = ...

-- Automatically loads `war3map.wts`, if found.
local strings = map.strings

-- Doing this clears the specified key from the build environment, thus
-- preventing Map from processing it and writing a new file.  Instead, the
-- status of the file will be pulled from the imports table.
map.strings = nil

-- It is the key within the build environment that is special, not the
-- returned data.
print (#strings)

-- This will write an empty `war3map.wts` into the output archive.  Note
-- that an empty table is not a valid input for all files supported by Map,
-- and errors may be encountered.
map.strings = {}

-- This will error, as there is expected data missing.
map.information = {}
```

### Settings

The entire settings table is provided as-is in a read-only fashion.

``` lua
local map = ...

print (map.settings.script.input) -- 'path/to/input.lua'
```

### Information

All values present within the `war3map.w3i` can be edited.  For details,
please consult the source file for [W3I](file/war3map/w3i.lua) handling.
For example:

``` lua
local map = ...

map.information.map.name = 'A Map'
````

### Imports

All existing files in the input archive, including those not specified
within the `war3map.imp`, are listed by default.  This knowledge can be
leveraged to prevent any file in the input archive from being included in
the output archive.

When referencing imports, only `string` and `number` keys are supported,
with `string` ones being for individual files, and `number` ones for entire
directories.  Other key types are ignored.

``` lua
local map = ...

-- The file with this name will be copied from the input archive to the
-- output archive.
map.imports ['file.txt'] = true

-- Import the file specified by the provide path to the output archive using
-- the given name.
map.imports ['A/B/stuff.txt'] = 'path/to/imports/other.txt'

-- Clear an already specified import.
map.imports ['file.txt'] = nil

-- Import a directory's contents, preserving its structure.  Note that
-- `number` keys are iterated in ascending order, and do not need to be
-- contiguous.  These are processed after `string` keys.
map.imports [1] = 'path/to/directory'
map.imports [2] = 'path/to/another/directory'
```

### Objects

Object modifications for all object types (i.e. abilities, destructables,
doodads, units, upgrades, items, and buffs) can be edited.  All object data
has been merged together.  This includes different object types, as well as
those that are considered 'original' and 'custom'.

An object has the following general format:

``` lua
local map = ...

map.objects ['A000'] = {
    type = 'ability', -- Indicates the type of object.  See below.
    base = 'ACev' -- If present, implies a 'custom' object.

    -- Example of a modification that has no levels.
    anam = {
        type = 'string',
        value = 'An Example'
    },

    -- Example of a modification that has levels.
    atp1 = {
        type = 'string',
        values = {
            [1] = 'Based on Evasion!',
            [2] = 'Definitely based on Evasion!'
        }
    },

    -- Example of a modification that has 'custom' data.
    Eev1 = {
        data = 1,
        type = 'unreal',
        values = {
            [1] = 0,
            [2] = 0
        }
    }
}
```

An object 'type' must be one of the following strings:

- `ability`
- `destructable`
- `doodad`
- `unit`
- `upgrade`
- `item`
- `buff`

A modification 'type' must be one of the following strings:

- `string`
- `integer`
- `real`
- `unreal`

### Constants

All constant file modifications present within the map can be edited.  Note
that only modifications will be exposed.  Default values will not be
available.  For example:

``` lua
local map = ...

print (map.constants.interface.FrameDef.LUMBER) --> nil
map.constants.interface.FrameDef.LUMBER = 'Not Lumber'
```

The following files are exposed:

- `war3mapSkin.txt`: `interface`
- `war3mapMisc.txt`: `gameplay`
- `war3mapExtra.txt`: `extra`

### Strings

``` lua
local map = ...

print (map.strings [1]) --> 'Force 1'
map.strings [2] = 'Just another Warcraft III map'
```

### Regions

```lua
local map = ...

print (map.regions [1].name) --> 'Region 000'
map.regions [1].name = 'New Name'
```

### Cameras

```lua
local map = ...

print (map.cameras [1].name) --> 'Camera ABC'
map.cameras [1].name = 'Camera XYZ'
```

### Doodads

```lua
local map = ...

print (map.doodads [1].type) --> 'LTlt'
map.doodads [1].life = 50
```

### Units/Items

```lua
local map = ...

print (map.units [1].type) --> 'hfoo'
map.units [1].player = 3
```

### Sounds

```lua
local map = ...

print (map.sounds [1].effect) --> 'SpellsEAX'
map.sounds [1].volume = 10
```

### Terrain

```lua
local map = ...

map.terrain.tileset = 'A'

for _, row in ipairs (map.terrain.tiles) do
    for _, tile in ipairs (row) do
        print (tile.ground.texture) --> 0
    end
end
```

### Pathing

```lua
local map = ...

for _, row in ipairs (map.pathing.cells) do
    for _, cell in ipairs (row) do
        print (cell.buildable) --> false
    end
end
```
