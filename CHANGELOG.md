- For the W3I table, `type` has been renamed to `format`.
- Update WC3 ids for 1.32.0.
- IMP handling has been enhanced. The byte present before file paths is now
  exposed, and defaults to the value used in 1.32.0 (i.e. `0x1D`).
- W3X import handling has been enhanced, and is aware of WE ignored files.
- The build task now uses the W3I format to determine the proper IMP byte to

### Added
- Lua support.  This introduces new dependencies: `luac` (part of Lua) and
  Luacheck.

### Changed
- The `check` command now leverages Luacheck.  By default, a luacheckrc
  provided by Map is used.  A user can provide their own as well.
- The `build` command now functions conditionally, according to settings in
  the configuration file.  Luacheck is used here as well.

  [README](README.md) for details.  Of particular note is that some settings
  are now optional by default.

### Removed
- Jass support has been removed completely.

  removed.  This is a result of only supporting Lua.

## [0.6.5] - 2019-04-28
### Fixed

  incompatibility introduced with built maps and 1.31 PTR.

  `wurst.dependencies` when using the `build` and `optimize` commands.

## [0.6.3] - 2019-03-27
### Added
- Automatically handle the following Wurst related paths:
  - `wurst`
  - `wurst.dependencies`

### Added
- Merge Wurst generated objects, if they exist.

## [0.6.1] - 2019-02-13

  alphanumerically, rather than the LFS default.
- Constant literal globals are now considered from multiple globals blocks
  within a single file.
- An `output.directories` table has been added that allows specifying the
  location to place built maps for the `build` and `optimize` commands.

### Fixed

- Properly identify constant literal strings.

### Removed
- The `output.directory` setting has been removed.

## [0.5.0] - 2018-09-27

  'prepare' command.
- A standardized map environment now exists for all commands. This map
  environment can be customized by the user using the `environment` setting.

### Changed
- The 'check' command now displays parse results to 'stdout' regardless of
  the outcome. Note that other errors continue to write to 'stderr'.
- The 'prepare' command has been reworked, and will no longer be destructive
  by default. The '--force' flag can be used to overwrite an existing file.
- The 'imports' command now works upon a list of Lua files (like the
  'objects' and 'constants' commands), rather than a single directory.
- The configuration file format has changed extensively. See the
  [README](README.md) for details.
